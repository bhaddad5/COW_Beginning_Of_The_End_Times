;RULES with religious buildings
;Same religion factions will like you a little more, but all other will like you less as you are a threat to their "gods"
;Huge catholic/muslim buildings will make your own religion mates to like you less.., yes.. they are jealows.. / Orthodox will act the opposite.
;There should be more rules when you reach X buildings.. (under work)
